    <h3>Randy's Slow Cooker Ravioli Lasagna</h3>
    <p>Though often associated with Italian cuisine, lasagna’s roots trace back to ancient Greece. The word "lasagna" comes from the Greek "lasagnum," meaning "chamber pot," which referred to a type of flat pasta baked in the oven.</p>
    <p>Lasagna became widely popular in the United States thanks to Italian immigrants. They adapted the recipe using locally available ingredients, like ricotta instead of traditional Italian cheeses.</p>
    <p>The traditional Italian lasagna, especially from Emilia-Romagna, is layered with ragù (meat sauce), béchamel (white sauce), and Parmesan cheese. Meanwhile, American versions often use ricotta, mozzarella, and tomato sauce.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 bag (25 oz) frozen cheese or meat ravioli</li>
        <li>1 jar (24 oz) marinara or pasta sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup ricotta or cottage cheese (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Fresh basil or parsley for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Layer Sauce: Pour a thin layer of marinara sauce on the bottom of your slow cooker.</li>
        <li>Add Ravioli: Place a single layer of frozen ravioli on top of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Cheese Layer: Add a layer of ricotta or cottage cheese (if using) and sprinkle some mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat Layers: Repeat the layering with sauce, ravioli, and cheeses until you’ve used up all the ingredients, ending with a final layer of sauce and mozzarella on top.</li>
        <li>Cook: Cover the slow cooker and cook on <strong>low for 4-5 hours</strong> or on <strong>high for 2-3 hours</strong>, until the ravioli is tender and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Serve: Garnish with fresh basil or parsley if desired, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
