    <h3>Chef Nikolaos Tselementes' classic Moussaka</h3>
    <p>Moussaka is widely recognized as a classic Greek dish, but its origins span across the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern regions. Its most famous version is Greek, but variations are popular in Turkey, Egypt, and the Balkans.</p>
    <p>Traditional Greek moussaka consists of layered eggplant, ground meat (usually lamb or beef), and a creamy béchamel sauce on top. These layers are baked to golden perfection, creating a casserole-like dish.</p>
    <p>The creamy top layer of Greek moussaka is a thick béchamel sauce, made from butter, flour, and milk, and often enriched with egg yolks. This layer adds a custard-like texture and rich flavor.</p>
    <p>
        Moussaka can be calorie-dense, especially due to the béchamel and fried eggplant layers, but variations with roasted vegetables or less béchamel are popular for lighter options.
        Moussaka is a Mediterranean comfort food, much like lasagna. It’s often served as a special treat in Greece and worldwide, particularly in cooler weather.
    </p>
    <p>The modern version of moussaka, with its iconic béchamel topping, was popularized in the 1920s by Greek chef Nikolaos Tselementes, who trained in France and wanted to bring French culinary elements into Greek cuisine.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggplants (sliced into 1/4-inch rounds)</li>
        <li>3 medium potatoes (sliced into 1/4-inch rounds)</li>
        <li>1 lb ground lamb or beef</li>
        <li>1 large onion (chopped)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
        <li>1 can (14 oz) crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/4 cup red wine (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Olive oil (for frying)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Béchamel Sauce</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare Eggplant and Potatoes:
            Sprinkle the eggplant slices with salt and let sit for 20 minutes to reduce bitterness. Rinse and pat dry.
            Heat olive oil in a pan and lightly fry the eggplant and potato slices until golden. Place on paper towels to absorb excess oil.
        </li>
        <li>Make Meat Sauce:
            In a large pan, sauté the onion and garlic until soft. Add ground meat, breaking it up, and cook until browned.
            Add crushed tomatoes, red wine, cinnamon, salt, and pepper. Let simmer for 15-20 minutes until thickened. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Prepare Béchamel Sauce:
            Melt butter in a saucepan. Add flour, whisking constantly for 1-2 minutes.
            Gradually whisk in milk until smooth. Continue stirring until thickened.
            Remove from heat, let cool slightly, then whisk in egg yolk and Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Assemble:
            Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
            Layer potatoes on the bottom of a baking dish, followed by a layer of eggplant.
            Spread the meat sauce evenly on top, then add another layer of eggplant.
            Pour the béchamel sauce over the top layer, smoothing it with a spatula.
        </li>
        <li>Bake:
            Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until the top is golden and bubbly.
            Let it cool for a few minutes before serving for easier slicing.
