    <h3>Te de Canela (Cinnamon Tea)</h3>
    <p>I have been drinking te de canela, or cinnamon tea, since I was a kid. My mother always made it for us when we had a sore throat, a fever or just because. This cinnamon tea can be sweetened with honey, sugar, or piloncillo, which is Mexican brown sugar, and we often added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. As adults the tea is spiked with pure cane alcohol, which is very common amongst Hispanic people.</p>
